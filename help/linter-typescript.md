# Typescript Linter Plugin for Micro

This plugin provides the ability to lint your Typescript (.ts & .tsx) files with `tsc` and the default `linter` plugin built into micro.

## Requirements

It requires that you have `tsc` available in your path. So, `npm i -g typescript` would do the job in most cases.

You also need to add the syntax for `.tsx` files in `.config/micro/syntax`.

## Install

Install with `> plugin install lintertypescript`.
